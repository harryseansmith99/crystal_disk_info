# Project

**This script is made to collect Prometheus metrics for the disk of the PC, using an application called CrystalDiskInfo**

Metrics are collected for each drive on the PC/server, consisting of:
- Disk Model
- Disk temperature
- Disk size
- Disk Health


# Information

The version of CrystalDiskInfo used in this program is **CrystalDiskInfo8_17_3**

This project was created at a summer internship, I would say that this was my first ever "proper" project and I am by no means a professional programmer at this stage
